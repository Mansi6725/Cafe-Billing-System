Cafe Billing System in java
The project Cafe Billing System is a program for monitoring and controlling the transactions in a Cafe.
This project focuses on basic operation in a cafe’s billing like-taking the order from the customer and generating the bill.
The main purpose of this project is to reduce the manual work.

The system provides a robust architecture to provide excellent User Experience for the user to interact. The key functionalities are listed below:
1. The system welcomes the customer with a welcome message. This will make the customer happy with the service of the cafe.
2. The system provided necessary information regarding the input to be given to continue the ordering process. The system performs the validation of each user input. So, if by mistake the user enters an invalid input, the system will prompt the user and will ask for valid input.
3. The system provides clear information on the menu items along with the item code and price of the respective item. These item codes further enhance the user experience by providing easy input technique rather than using full name of the item.
4. The system also takes the account of customer’s name. This name could be
later used to identify the customer once the order is ready.
5. If the user orders multiple food items which are part of a set meal, the
system identifies those items and charges only the price of that set meal.
Further information is given in the Extra Feature.
6. The system can detect all set meals from the ordered list.
7. The system also offers an option to add the quantity of the item.

Special Processes:
Extra Feature: Suppose the user orders five items two of which are part of one set, two of another set and one is independent item. The system will detect the set and add its price and not the price of independent item present in the set.
This feature will allow the customer to save money and this will add to the market value of the Café, as the customer will be happy with this service. Due to this feature, the Ordering System will not only provide excellent experience to the user, but also to the customer.
